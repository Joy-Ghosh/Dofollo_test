This view helps you assess how well your pages are connected internally and externally, as well as identify new opportunities for internal linking.\n\n## Incoming Links\n\nThis shows how many internal links across your site point to each page. Pages with more incoming links are better connected, which helps improve crawlability, distribute page authority, boost search visibility, and enhance user navigation.\n\n## Outgoing Links\n\nThe Outgoing Links column shows the number of internal links each page contains that point to other pages within your website. These links help distribute authority across your site and improve content discoverability. External links to other domains are tracked separately.\n\n## External Links\n\nThe External Links column shows how many links on each page point to external domains outside your website. High-quality external links help signal credibility and relevance when they lead to trusted sources, and can improve your site\u2019s authority in the eyes of search engines.\n\n## Opportunities\n\nThe Opportunities column shows the total number of internal link opportunities Dofollo\u2019s AI has identified for each page based on contextual relevance. These suggestions include incoming and outgoing link ideas, focused on strengthening internal structure and boosting SEO visibility.\n\n## Start Link Planning\n\nThe Start Link Planning option opens the Plan Your Page view for the selected page. It shows all AI-suggested internal link opportunities, along with recommended anchor texts and contextual match scores. Use this panel to manage and publish internal links.\n\n## Rescan\n\nThe Rescan option lets you manually update a page\u2019s data after making changes, especially to content or internal links. While Dofollo updates pages automatically over time, rescanning ensures your new changes are reflected immediately in link suggestions.\n\n## Open in a New Tab\n\nThe Open in a New Tab option opens the source page (the page from which a link is being suggested) in a new browser tab. Use this when you need to manually view the content before deciding whether to place the internal link.\n\n## Search and Filters\n\nThe Search bar lets you quickly locate any page by its URL, especially useful for large sites. You can use Orphan and Broken filters to instantly view pages with no internal links or pages with link issues that need fixing.\n\n## List View\n\nThe List View displays all your pages in a structured table format with columns for internal links, external links, opportunities, and actions. This default view provides comprehensive data at a glance.\n\n## Radial View\n\nThe Radial View visualizes your website\u2019s internal link structure in a hierarchical graph. It helps you understand how pages are connected at a glance and is useful for spotting isolated pages or weak internal linking. You can Ctrl-Click on any node to open its Page Level View.\n\n## Radial View Settings\n\nRadial View settings let you customize how the site structure is displayed. You can set Max Node Count to control how many pages are shown per layer in the graph, helping avoid visual clutter on large sites.\n\n## Exclude Parameters\n\nExclude Parameters allows you to hide pages based on URL patterns, such as /tags or /search, that aren\u2019t meaningful for internal linking. This keeps the graph focused on pages important to link structure."

Here you\u2019ll find incoming and outgoing link suggestions, suggested anchor text, contextual match score (%), and tabs for existing and planned links. Use the Create Link button to export or publish links.\n\n## Step 8: WordPress Integration (One-Time Setup)\n\nWhen you click \u201cCreate Link\u201d for the first time on a WordPress site, you\u2019ll be prompted to complete the WordPress integration by entering your WordPress admin credentials securely. Once integrated, your site will be connected to Dofollo permanently.\n\n## Step 9: Publishing a Link (WordPress Only)\n\nAfter integration, clicking \u201cCreate Link\u201d opens the source page and shows the recommended anchor text. Review or edit the anchor text as needed, then click Publish to instantly insert the internal link into your content."

The All tab displays all saved link plans. Recent shows pages with newly updated link plans. Stale lists link plans that haven\u2019t been updated in a while and may need review or action.\n\n## Search by URL\n\nUse the Search by URL feature to quickly locate a specific page within your planned links list by typing in the page\u2019s URL. This is useful for large sites with many planned link entries.\n\n## Page List\n\nThe Page List section displays each page for which you have saved planned links. It shows the page URL, the date the link suggestion was last modified, and action buttons to manage that plan. Clicking a page URL opens its planning panel for deeper review.\n\n## Deleting Draft Links\n\nYou can delete any planned (draft) internal link that hasn\u2019t been published yet. Using the Delete icon next to the saved link removes the unpublished suggestion from your planned queue without affecting live pages on your website.\n\n## Plan New Page\n\nThe Plan New Page option opens a pop-up where you can enter the URL of a target page you want to plan links for.

This connection is required only once and remains active for future link publishing actions.\n\n## When the Connect Popup Appears\n\nThe Connect Your Website pop-up appears when you try to publish an internal link from Dofollo but haven\u2019t yet completed the WordPress integration. You can follow the steps in the pop-up to connect your site and enable direct publishing.\n\n## Benefits of Connecting WordPress\n\nConnecting WordPress with Dofollo provides several benefits: it links your WordPress backend with the Dofollo dashboard, enables direct publishing of internal links, and eliminates the need to manually open your WordPress admin to add links. Once connected, you can apply AI-recommended links instantly, saving time and making the link building workflow easier\u2014especially for larger sites.\n\n## Using Dofollo Without WordPress Integration\n\nEven if you don\u2019t integrate WordPress, you can still view internal link suggestions within Dofollo. However, direct publishing of those links to your live site won\u2019t be possible until WordPress is connected."

Once you are satisfied with the anchor text and placement, clicking Publish inserts the link into the page\u2019s content.\n\n## When to Use Publish Link\n\nUse the Publish Link option after reviewing the AI-suggested internal link, ensuring the anchor text is appropriate and contextually relevant to both the source and destination pages. This ensures the link adds SEO value and improves navigability.\n\n## Requirements\n\nTo successfully publish an internal link directly from Dofollo, your website must be integrated with WordPress. Without WordPress integration, you won\u2019t be able to insert the link automatically and will need to export the link details for manual implementation.\n\n## What Happens on Publish\n\nWhen you click Publish, Dofollo pushes the link into your live content on WordPress, adding the selected anchor text and updating the page structure. This saves time compared to manually editing each page in your CMS.\n\n## Manual Alternative (Non-WordPress Sites)\n\nIf your site is not connected to WordPress, you can still use Dofollo\u2019s link suggestions by exporting them in CSV or other formats. Then manually add the internal links within your CMS using the recommended anchor text and source/destination details."
