            {
                "question": "Does the auto-injection work with headless CMS?",
                "answer": "Yes. For headless environments (Contentful, Sanity, Strapi), Dofollo provides a REST API and webhooks. You can review suggestions in our dashboard, and we push the changes to your content model JSON/HTML fields automatically."
            },
            {
                "question": "What happens if I cancel? Do I lose my links?",
                "answer": "Absolutely not. The links Dofollo builds are inserted directly into your content's HTML. If you cancel your subscription, the links remain 100% yours forever. We don't use JavaScript redirects or overlays."
            },
            {
                "question": "Can I blacklist specific pages or keywords?",
                "answer": "Yes. You have granular control to exclude specific URLs (like T&Cs, Login pages) or specific anchor text patterns. You can also set 'negative keywords' to ensure brand safety."
            },
            {
                "question": "Does Dofollo slow down my website?",
                "answer": "No. Dofollo operates as an external analysis tool. The only interaction with your live site is when you approve a link injection, which is a static HTML update. We do not inject any client-side scripts that affect page load speed."
