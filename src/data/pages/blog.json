However, planning and implementing an internal linking strategy could be a time-consuming endeavor.&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, Dofollo is here to help you build and implement your internal linking strategy on any website with ease.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you are running an SEO agency or working as a freelancer, you don't want to spend a lot of time doing the grunt work of auditing your internal links &amp; finding new internal link oppertunities. You need an SEO tool that will help you implement the internal linking strategy efficiently and not make you do a lot of unwanted, time-consuming, and mind-numbing tasks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://placehold.co/1024x508/0A2E22/E1F28F?text=Dofollo%2BDashboard\" alt=\"Dofollo Dashboard\" class=\"wp-image-1594\" style=\"object-fit:cover\"/></figure><p>There are a few tools are available that promise to help with the internal linking process, but most of them are mainly focused on checking keyword positions rather than on the internal link-building strategy.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, using Ahrefs or Google Search Console tools can help you find your existing internal links to some extent. However, they have limitations, as they do not fare very well when it comes to finding internal linking opportunities and adding those links to your website is a manual &amp; tedious task.</p><p>If you have a WordPress website, there are some plugins available in the WordPress ecosystem which helps you with the internal linking opportunities. However, these plugins can only suggest the outgoing link from a page you are currently working on. This can be challenging for building a strong internal linking strategy, as you can't see any suggestions for incoming links, especially when you are publishing a spanking new blog post.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Dofollo can reduce your headache by making this internal link-building process much easier. Dofollo gives you a top-level view of your current <a href=\"https://www.semrush.com/blog/internal-links/\">internal links</a> and shows you new internal link opportunities based on AI recommendations for building more internal links.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, Dofollo allows you the unique ability to add the newly planned links to your website from the Dofollo console itself without having to visit your website, and that too with the right anchor text.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What can Dofollo do?&nbsp;</h2><ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Audit Internal Links</strong></li><li><strong>Find Internal Linking Opportunities</strong></li><li><strong>Add New Internal Links to Your Website.</strong></li><li><strong>Remove Unnecessary Internal Links</strong></li></ol><div class=\"main-card-for-some card-cta\"><div class=\"card-content\"><h2 class=\"heading-card\">Manage Your <span class=\"h1-span\">Internal Links</span><br />with AI for Better SEO Rankings</h2><div class=\"up-mt-1\"><a href=\"https://linke.to/jbhj\" class=\"btn-blue\">Check Your Internal Links</a></div></div></div><h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Audit Internal Links</h3><p>To implement any internal linking strategy, first you need to know the current status of your internal links. In Dofollo, you can visualize the incoming and outgoing links (including backlinks and external links) for any given page on your website on a single screen. This visualisation helps you build a better understanding of your current status on internal links.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://placehold.co/1024x651/f5ffef/0A2E22?text=Audit%2BInternal%2BLinks\" alt=\"Audit Internal Links\" class=\"wp-image-1604\" style=\"object-fit:cover\"/></figure><p>In the above image, you can see the incoming links and outgoing links for the pricing page of RabbitLoader.com, as well as the number of backlinks and external links.</p><p>With Dofollo you visualize the top level overview, which helps you with comprehending the status of internal linking for any given page.&nbsp;</p><p>The visualization of the incoming &amp; outgoing links allows you to make informed decisions on whether you need to make changes to your internal linking strategy.</p><h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Find Internal Linking Opportunities</h3><p>Manually finding internal linking opportunities can be time consuming &amp; most of the time you are just relying on your intuition, especially when it comes to a large website.

The suggestions are generated using AI to give you the best possible linking opportunity.&nbsp;</p><p>You can also add the links manually or change the anchor text of the AI suggested links if you need.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https://placehold.co/800x500/0A2E22/E1F28F?text=AI%2BSuggestion%2BIncoming%2Band%2BOutgoing\" alt=\"AI Suggestion Incoming and Outgoing\" class=\"wp-image-1602\" style=\"width:520px;height:auto\"/></figure><p>Dofollo suggests both incoming as well as outgoing linking opportunities.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Add Potential Internal Links</h3><p>A few SEO tools out there can provide suggestions for internal linking opportunities, but you need to add internal links to the page by logging in to the website then navigating to each page &amp; finally selecting the anchor text &amp; create the link, which takes time.</p><div class=\"main-card-for-some card-cta\"><div class=\"card-content\"><h2 class=\"heading-card\">Manage Your <span class=\"h1-span\">Internal Links</span><br />with AI for Better SEO Rankings</h2><div class=\"up-mt-1\"><a href=\"https://linke.to/jbhj\" class=\"btn-blue\">Check Your Internal Links</a></div></div></div><p>However, with Dofollo, you don't need to spend your time on editing the pages.

Finally, to add the link on your website or blog just click \"Save\" &amp; \"Apply\" buttons.</p><h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Remove Unnecessary Internal Links</h3><p>After visualizing the internal links of a page, if you notice the presence of any unnecessary links, you can easily delete them right from the Dofollo console with just a couple of clicks. You don't need to waste any of your time trying to locate the link on the website.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://placehold.co/1024x508/045C4E/FFFFFF?text=Enable%2BDeletion\" alt=\"Enable Deletion\" class=\"wp-image-1599\" style=\"object-fit:cover\"/></figure><p>As shown in the image, first you need to enable deletion by turning on the toggle button.
