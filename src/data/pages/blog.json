            "content": "<p>As an SEO professional, you understand how important an internal linking strategy is for your organic rankings. However, planning and implementing an internal linking strategy could be a time-consuming endeavor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, Dofollo is here to help you build and implement your internal linking strategy on any website with ease.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If you are running an SEO agency or working as a freelancer, you don’t want to spend a lot of time doing the grunt work of auditing your internal links &amp; finding new internal link oppertunities. You need an SEO tool that will help you implement the internal linking strategy efficiently and not make you do a lot of unwanted, time-consuming, and mind-numbing tasks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/dofollo-dashboard-1024x508.jpg\" alt=\"dofollo dashboard\" class=\"wp-image-1594\" style=\"object-fit:cover\"/></figure>\n\n<p>There are a few tools are available that promise to help with the internal linking process, but most of them are mainly focused on checking keyword positions rather than on the internal link-building strategy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For example, using Aherfs or Google Search Console tools can help you find your existing internal links to some extent. However, they have limitations, as they do not fare very twell when it comes to finding internal linking opportunities and adding those links to the your website website is a manual &amp; tidious task.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a WordPress website, there are some plugins available in the WordPress ecosystem which helps you with the internal linking oppertunities. However, these plugins can only suggest the outgoing link from a page you are currently working on. This can be challenging for building a strong internal linking strategy, as you can’t see any suggestions for incoming links, especially when you are publishing a spanking new blog post.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Dofollo can reduce your headache by making this internal link-building process much easier. Dofollo gives you a top-level view of your current <a href=\"https://www.semrush.com/blog/internal-links/\">internal links</a> and shows you new internal link oppertunities based on AI recommendations for building more internal links.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In addition, Dofollo allow you the qnique ability to add the newly planned linked to your website from the Dofollo console itself without having to visit your website, and that too with the right anchor text.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What can Dofollo do?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Audit Internal Links</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>Find Internal Linking Opportunities</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>Add New Internal Links to Your Website.</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>Remove Unnecessary Internal Links</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    Document\n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    <main style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center\">\n\n      <div class=\"main-card-for-some\">\n\n        <div>\n\n          <h1 class=\"heading-card\">\n\n            Manage Your <span class=\"h1-span\">Internal Links</span><br />\n\n            with AI for Better SEO Rankings\n\n          </h1>\n\n          <div class=\"up-mt-1\">\n\n            <a href=\"https://linke.to/jbhj\" class=\"btn-blue\"\n\n              >Check Your Internal Links</a\n\n            >\n\n          </div>\n\n          <div class=\"card-caption-body\">\n\n            <div class=\"card-caption-text\">\n\n              <svg\n\n                xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\n\n                x=\"0px\"\n\n                y=\"0px\"\n\n                width=\"10\"\n\n                height=\"10\"\n\n                viewBox=\"0,0,256,256\"\n\n              >\n\n                <g\n\n                  fill=\"#007CFE\"\n\n                  fill-rule=\"nonzero\"\n\n                  stroke=\"none\"\n\n                  stroke-width=\"1\"\n\n                  stroke-linecap=\"butt\"\n\n                  stroke-linejoin=\"miter\"\n\n                  stroke-miterlimit=\"10\"\n\n                  stroke-dasharray=\"\"\n\n                  stroke-dashoffset=\"0\"\n\n                  font-weight=\"none\"\n\n                  font-size=\"none\"\n\n                  text-anchor=\"none\"\n\n                  style=\"mix-blend-mode: normal\"\n\n                >\n\n                  <g transform=\"scale(8.53333,8.53333)\">\n\n                    <path\n\n                      d=\"M26.98047,5.99023c-0.2598,0.00774 -0.50638,0.11632 -0.6875,0.30273l-15.29297,15.29297l-6.29297,-6.29297c-0.25082,-0.26124 -0.62327,-0.36647 -0.97371,-0.27511c-0.35044,0.09136 -0.62411,0.36503 -0.71547,0.71547c-0.09136,0.35044 0.01388,0.72289 0.27511,0.97371l7,7c0.39053,0.39037 1.02353,0.39037 1.41406,0l16,-16c0.29576,-0.28749 0.38469,-0.72707 0.22393,-1.10691c-0.16075,-0.37985 -0.53821,-0.62204 -0.9505,-0.60988z\"\n\n                    ></path>\n\n                  </g>\n\n                </g>\n\n              </svg>\n\n              No Technical Knowledge Required\n\n            </div>\n\n            <div class=\"card-caption-text\">\n\n              <svg\n\n                xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\n\n                x=\"0px\"\n\n                y=\"0px\"\n\n                width=\"10\"\n\n                height=\"10\"\n\n                viewBox=\"0,0,256,256\"\n\n              >\n\n                <g\n\n                  fill=\"#007CFE\"\n\n                  fill-rule=\"nonzero\"\n\n                  stroke=\"none\"\n\n                  stroke-width=\"1\"\n\n                  stroke-linecap=\"butt\"\n\n                  stroke-linejoin=\"miter\"\n\n                  stroke-miterlimit=\"10\"\n\n                  stroke-dasharray=\"\"\n\n                  stroke-dashoffset=\"0\"\n\n                  font-weight=\"none\"\n\n                  font-size=\"none\"\n\n                  text-anchor=\"none\"\n\n                  style=\"mix-blend-mode: normal\"\n\n                >\n\n                  <g transform=\"scale(8.53333,8.53333)\">\n\n                    <path\n\n                      d=\"M26.98047,5.99023c-0.2598,0.00774 -0.50638,0.11632 -0.6875,0.30273l-15.29297,15.29297l-6.29297,-6.29297c-0.25082,-0.26124 -0.62327,-0.36647 -0.97371,-0.27511c-0.35044,0.09136 -0.62411,0.36503 -0.71547,0.71547c-0.09136,0.35044 0.01388,0.72289 0.27511,0.97371l7,7c0.39053,0.39037 1.02353,0.39037 1.41406,0l16,-16c0.29576,-0.28749 0.38469,-0.72707 0.22393,-1.10691c-0.16075,-0.37985 -0.53821,-0.62204 -0.9505,-0.60988z\"\n\n                    ></path>\n\n                  </g>\n\n                </g>\n\n              </svg>\n\n              Get Notified for Your Backlinks Removals\n\n            </div>\n\n          </div>\n\n        </div>\n\n      </div>\n\n    </main>\n\n  \n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Audit Internal Links</h3>\n\n<p>To implement any internal linking strategy, first you need to know the current status of your internal links.

But if you have to do this 20/30 times for a day or maybe for 20/30 websites it consumes a lot more energy than what we would like to admin.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    Document\n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    <main style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center\">\n\n      <div class=\"main-card-for-some\">\n\n        <div>\n\n          <h1 class=\"heading-card\">\n\n            Manage Your <span class=\"h1-span\">Internal Links</span><br />\n\n            with AI for Better SEO Rankings\n\n          </h1>\n\n          <div class=\"up-mt-1\">\n\n            <a href=\"https://linke.to/jbhj\" class=\"btn-blue\"\n\n              >Check Your Internal Links</a\n\n            >\n\n          </div>\n\n          <div class=\"card-caption-body\">\n\n            <div class=\"card-caption-text\">\n\n              <svg\n\n                xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\n\n                x=\"0px\"\n\n                y=\"0px\"\n\n                width=\"10\"\n\n                height=\"10\"\n\n                viewBox=\"0,0,256,256\"\n\n              >\n\n                <g\n\n                  fill=\"#007CFE\"\n\n                  fill-rule=\"nonzero\"\n\n                  stroke=\"none\"\n\n                  stroke-width=\"1\"\n\n                  stroke-linecap=\"butt\"\n\n                  stroke-linejoin=\"miter\"\n\n                  stroke-miterlimit=\"10\"\n\n                  stroke-dasharray=\"\"\n\n                  stroke-dashoffset=\"0\"\n\n                  font-weight=\"none\"\n\n                  font-size=\"none\"\n\n                  text-anchor=\"none\"\n\n                  style=\"mix-blend-mode: normal\"\n\n                >\n\n                  <g transform=\"scale(8.53333,8.53333)\">\n\n                    <path\n\n                      d=\"M26.98047,5.99023c-0.2598,0.00774 -0.50638,0.11632 -0.6875,0.30273l-15.29297,15.29297l-6.29297,-6.29297c-0.25082,-0.26124 -0.62327,-0.36647 -0.97371,-0.27511c-0.35044,0.09136 -0.62411,0.36503 -0.71547,0.71547c-0.09136,0.35044 0.01388,0.72289 0.27511,0.97371l7,7c0.39053,0.39037 1.02353,0.39037 1.41406,0l16,-16c0.29576,-0.28749 0.38469,-0.72707 0.22393,-1.10691c-0.16075,-0.37985 -0.53821,-0.62204 -0.9505,-0.60988z\"\n\n                    ></path>\n\n                  </g>\n\n                </g>\n\n              </svg>\n\n              No Technical Knowledge Required\n\n            </div>\n\n            <div class=\"card-caption-text\">\n\n              <svg\n\n                xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\n\n                x=\"0px\"\n\n                y=\"0px\"\n\n                width=\"10\"\n\n                height=\"10\"\n\n                viewBox=\"0,0,256,256\"\n\n              >\n\n                <g\n\n                  fill=\"#007CFE\"\n\n                  fill-rule=\"nonzero\"\n\n                  stroke=\"none\"\n\n                  stroke-width=\"1\"\n\n                  stroke-linecap=\"butt\"\n\n                  stroke-linejoin=\"miter\"\n\n                  stroke-miterlimit=\"10\"\n\n                  stroke-dasharray=\"\"\n\n                  stroke-dashoffset=\"0\"\n\n                  font-weight=\"none\"\n\n                  font-size=\"none\"\n\n                  text-anchor=\"none\"\n\n                  style=\"mix-blend-mode: normal\"\n\n                >\n\n                  <g transform=\"scale(8.53333,8.53333)\">\n\n                    <path\n\n                      d=\"M26.98047,5.99023c-0.2598,0.00774 -0.50638,0.11632 -0.6875,0.30273l-15.29297,15.29297l-6.29297,-6.29297c-0.25082,-0.26124 -0.62327,-0.36647 -0.97371,-0.27511c-0.35044,0.09136 -0.62411,0.36503 -0.71547,0.71547c-0.09136,0.35044 0.01388,0.72289 0.27511,0.97371l7,7c0.39053,0.39037 1.02353,0.39037 1.41406,0l16,-16c0.29576,-0.28749 0.38469,-0.72707 0.22393,-1.10691c-0.16075,-0.37985 -0.53821,-0.62204 -0.9505,-0.60988z\"\n\n                    ></path>\n\n                  </g>\n\n                </g>\n\n              </svg>\n\n              Get Notified for Your Backlinks Removals\n\n            </div>\n\n          </div>\n\n        </div>\n\n      </div>\n\n    </main>\n\n  \n\n\n\n<p>However, with Dofollo, you don’t need to spend your time on editing the pages.

            "content": "<p>As an SEO expert, you know how crucial your internal linking strategy can be. But to implement an internal linking\n    strategy you must be able to see the existing internal links to your target page.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But if you are working on a website with a lot of pages, it could be an overwhelming task to find internal links that\n    already exist to your target page.</p>\n\n<p>As a digital marketing agency owner or a freelancer, time is money, and you don't wanna spend it on trying to\n    discover all current internal links. You need the process to be easy to conserve your time &amp; energy, so you can\n    spend it on more fruitful endeavours like building your internal link strategy &amp; finally implementing the links\n    on the website.</p>\n\n<p>Auditing the internal links that are already present on the website &amp; discovering new internal linking\n    opportunities for a freshly published blog post or even an old webpage need not take up all of your time dedicated\n    to optimizing the website.</p>\n\n<p>We would show you 3 different ways you can audit your website easily to find all the internal links to any page you\n    are working on so you can spend your time doing more rewarding SEO tasks that can result in your website achieving a\n    higher ranking in Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs). </p>\n\n<p>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Understanding Internal Linking With An Example</h2>\n\n<p>In simple terms, internal links indicate the hyperlinks that can redirect visitors &amp; search engine bots to\n    different pages in the same website or domain. For example adding the below line of code in the &lt;body> of the\n    HTML file of a page, you would create an internal link from that page to the Minify CSS Article page. </p>\n\n<pre\n    class=\"wp-block-code language-html\"><code><strong>&lt;a href=\\\"https://rabbitloader.com/articles/minify-css//\\\"&gt;adding an internal link&lt;/a&gt;</strong></code></pre>\n\n<p>In the example of the above is a dofollow link, the target page is\n    <strong>https://rabbitloader.com/articles/minify-css//</strong> and <strong>adding an internal link</strong> is the\n    anchor text. However, to add the nofollow link, you need to follow the below syntax:</p>\n\n<pre\n    class=\"wp-block-code language-html\"><code><strong>&lt;a href=\\\"https://rabbitloader.com/articles/minify-css//\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\"&gt;How to blog&lt;/a&gt;</strong></code></pre>\n\n<p>Adding rel=\\\"nofollow \\\"within the Ahref tag would turn the link into a no-follow link.</p>\n\n<p>The key goal of building an effective internal linking strategy is to pass the page’s authority to a low-ranking\n    pag,e which can help the web page rank higher in Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs). Let’s understand the internal\n    links with an example. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img\n        src=\"https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Interlinking-example.jpg\" alt=\"Interlinking example\"\n        class=\"wp-image-1630\" style=\"width:778px;height:auto\" /></figure>\n\n<p><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\">Assume you have clicked the link\n        “<strong>Interaction to Next Paint</strong>” on the <strong>Minify CSS</strong> blog post on\n        RabbitLoader.com.</span> It would redirect you to the INP page which is within the RabbitLoader website. This\n    kind of hyperlink is known as an internal link. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the link points to a web page of a different website or domain instead of the same website,\n    it is known as an external link.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Importance Of Internal Links in SEO</h2>\n\n<p>If you are following SEO trends, you would realize lately the trend has been to focus on a robust internal linking\n    strategy. But the expert SEOs have been doing this for years now.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s concentrate on the importance of building a strong internal linking strategy:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n    <li><strong>A strong internal linking strategy helps pass the page authority/ link equity.</strong></li>\n\n    <li><strong>A well-structured internal linking strategy improves the crawling and indexing of your website.</strong>\n    </li>\n\n    <li><strong>Providing relevant internal links can increase a website’s average on-page time.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Strong Internal Linking Strategy Helps to Pass the Page Authority / Link\n    Equity&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p>Google developed E-E-A-T to help you establish a page with a higher ranking potential where ”A” stands for\n    Authoritativeness. Links from authority pages boost your organic ranking &amp; help you read the summit of the\n    SERPs.</p>\n\n<p>Getting authoritative backlinks is not only difficult, but it would also be a costly affair. While getting\n    authoritative internal links from your website is within your control &amp; doesn't need you to spend any money.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s easily understand this. If we go by the logic, if a page is ranking on top of a Google search result, it has\n    the highest authority among all the competing pages now this could be for various reasons. Still, whatever the\n    reason is, since it ranks on top, google assigns the top most value to it among the competing pages.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    Document\n\n\n\n\n    <main style=\"display:flex;justify-content:center;\">\n        <div class=\"main-card-for-some\">\n            <div>\n                <h1 class=\"heading-card\">Manage Your <span class=\"h1-span\">Internal Links</span><br>\n                    with AI for Better SEO Rankings</h1>\n                <div class=\"up-mt-1\">\n                    <a href=\"https://linke.to/jbhj\" class=\"btn-blue\">Check Your Internal Links</a>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"card-caption-body\">\n                    <div class=\"card-caption-text\">\n                        <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\" width=\"10\" height=\"10\"\n                            viewBox=\"0,0,256,256\">\n                            <g fill=\"#007CFE\" fill-rule=\"nonzero\" stroke=\"none\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-linecap=\"butt\"\n                                stroke-linejoin=\"miter\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-dasharray=\"\" stroke-dashoffset=\"0\"\n                                font-family=\"none\" font-weight=\"none\" font-size=\"none\" text-anchor=\"none\"\n                                style=\"mix-blend-mode: normal\">\n                                <g transform=\"scale(8.53333,8.53333)\">\n                                    <path\n                                        d=\"M26.98047,5.99023c-0.2598,0.00774 -0.50638,0.11632 -0.6875,0.30273l-15.29297,15.29297l-6.29297,-6.29297c-0.25082,-0.26124 -0.62327,-0.36647 -0.97371,-0.27511c-0.35044,0.09136 -0.62411,0.36503 -0.71547,0.71547c-0.09136,0.35044 0.01388,0.72289 0.27511,0.97371l7,7c0.39053,0.39037 1.02353,0.39037 1.41406,0l16,-16c0.29576,-0.28749 0.38469,-0.72707 0.22393,-1.10691c-0.16075,-0.37985 -0.53821,-0.62204 -0.9505,-0.60988z\">\n                                    </path>\n                                </g>\n                            </g>\n                        </svg>\n                        No Technical Knowledge Required\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"card-caption-text\">\n                        <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\" width=\"10\" height=\"10\"\n                            viewBox=\"0,0,256,256\">\n                            <g fill=\"#007CFE\" fill-rule=\"nonzero\" stroke=\"none\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-linecap=\"butt\"\n                                stroke-linejoin=\"miter\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-dasharray=\"\" stroke-dashoffset=\"0\"\n                                font-family=\"none\" font-weight=\"none\" font-size=\"none\" text-anchor=\"none\"\n                                style=\"mix-blend-mode: normal\">\n                                <g transform=\"scale(8.53333,8.53333)\">\n                                    <path\n                                        d=\"M26.98047,5.99023c-0.2598,0.00774 -0.50638,0.11632 -0.6875,0.30273l-15.29297,15.29297l-6.29297,-6.29297c-0.25082,-0.26124 -0.62327,-0.36647 -0.97371,-0.27511c-0.35044,0.09136 -0.62411,0.36503 -0.71547,0.71547c-0.09136,0.35044 0.01388,0.72289 0.27511,0.97371l7,7c0.39053,0.39037 1.02353,0.39037 1.41406,0l16,-16c0.29576,-0.28749 0.38469,-0.72707 0.22393,-1.10691c-0.16075,-0.37985 -0.53821,-0.62204 -0.9505,-0.60988z\">\n                                    </path>\n                                </g>\n                            </g>\n                        </svg>\n                        Get Notified for Your Backlinks Removals\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </main>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Since, having a higher SEO ranking indicates the web page has some authority. Backlinking from this page to a newly\n    published blog post can improve the link equity of the newly published blog. Here, you are passing on some authority\n    to the newly published blog through an internal link, given the new blog post is contextually somewhat similar.</p>\n\n<p>Adding internal backlinks from the blog, which is already ranking well in Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs), can\n    pass the page authority or link equity, which might improve the ranking of the newly published blog. </p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Well-Structured Internal Linking Strategy Improves the Crawling and Indexing of a website\n</h3>\n\n<p>In order to determine the ranking of a web page in SERPs, first a search bot needs to crawl the web page and index\n    the page. A strong, well-structured internal linking strategy can generate a pathway that leads a search bot to\n    crawl and index the page’s content more frequently.</p>\n\n<p>Especially when a website has a limited crawl budget (how many pages a search engine can crawl within a given time\n    period), building an internal linking strategy would improve the indexing time. </p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Providing Relevant Internal Links Can Increase a Website’s Average On-Page Time.</h3>\n\n<p>Providing the relevant internal links on a page can enhance the user experience. Users would find it easier to find\n    the content that they are actually looking for, which can engage the user with the website’s content for a longer\n    time.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img\n        src=\"https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Average-On-Page-Time-1024x438.jpg\"\n        alt=\"Average On-Page Time\" class=\"wp-image-1634\" /></figure>\n\n<p>Average on-page time indicates the span of time a user spends on a website. Engaging the user with the website’s\n    content can significantly improve the website’s on-page time, which in turn can also help you build trust &amp;\n    loyalty with the visitors &amp; help you achieve a desirable conversion rate.   </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Do You Need To Find The Internal Links To A Page</h2>\n\n<p>To improve something, you should be able to measure it &amp; see the current status. It is the same when implementing\n    an internal link strategy. You would need to know how many internal links your target page is getting, check if they\n    are contextually similar or not, this top level view would allow you to take educated decision rather than blindly\n    adding a bunch of internal link to a page you wish to rank o google.</p>\n\n<p>Here are 4 reasons to find internal links to the page before implementing a link building strategy.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n    <li><strong>Plan implementation of internal linking strategy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></li>\n\n    <li><strong>Identify the broken internal links</strong></li>\n\n    <li><strong>Find the orphan pages&nbsp;</strong></li>\n\n    <li><strong>Find the internal linking opportunities&nbsp;</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Plan Implementation of Internal Linking Strategy&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p>By auditing the internal links of a web page, you can visualize all internal links of the pages. It helps you easily\n    determine If you need to add more links for a better ranking in Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs). In addition,\n    with the help of internal link auditing, you can identify and remove if there's any wrong or unnecessary internal\n    links already present on the page.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    Document\n\n\n\n\n    <main style=\"display:flex;justify-content:center;\">\n        <div class=\"main-card-for-some\">\n            <div>\n                <h1 class=\"heading-card\">Manage Your <span class=\"h1-span\">Internal Links</span><br>\n                    with AI for Better SEO Rankings</h1>\n                <div class=\"up-mt-1\">\n                    <a href=\"https://linke.to/jbhj\" class=\"btn-blue\">Check Your Internal Links</a>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"card-caption-body\">\n                    <div class=\"card-caption-text\">\n                        <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\" width=\"10\" height=\"10\"\n                            viewBox=\"0,0,256,256\">\n                            <g fill=\"#007CFE\" fill-rule=\"nonzero\" stroke=\"none\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-linecap=\"butt\"\n                                stroke-linejoin=\"miter\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-dasharray=\"\" stroke-dashoffset=\"0\"\n                                font-family=\"none\" font-weight=\"none\" font-size=\"none\" text-anchor=\"none\"\n                                style=\"mix-blend-mode: normal\">\n                                <g transform=\"scale(8.53333,8.53333)\">\n                                    <path\n                                        d=\"M26.98047,5.99023c-0.2598,0.00774 -0.50638,0.11632 -0.6875,0.30273l-15.29297,15.29297l-6.29297,-6.29297c-0.25082,-0.26124 -0.62327,-0.36647 -0.97371,-0.27511c-0.35044,0.09136 -0.62411,0.36503 -0.71547,0.71547c-0.09136,0.35044 0.01388,0.72289 0.27511,0.97371l7,7c0.39053,0.39037 1.02353,0.39037 1.41406,0l16,-16c0.29576,-0.28749 0.38469,-0.72707 0.22393,-1.10691c-0.16075,-0.37985 -0.53821,-0.62204 -0.9505,-0.60988z\">\n                                    </path>\n                                </g>\n                            </g>\n                        </svg>\n                        No Technical Knowledge Required\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"card-caption-text\">\n                        <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\" width=\"10\" height=\"10\"\n                            viewBox=\"0,0,256,256\">\n                            <g fill=\"#007CFE\" fill-rule=\"nonzero\" stroke=\"none\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-linecap=\"butt\"\n                                stroke-linejoin=\"miter\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-dasharray=\"\" stroke-dashoffset=\"0\"\n                                font-family=\"none\" font-weight=\"none\" font-size=\"none\" text-anchor=\"none\"\n                                style=\"mix-blend-mode: normal\">\n                                <g transform=\"scale(8.53333,8.53333)\">\n                                    <path\n                                        d=\"M26.98047,5.99023c-0.2598,0.00774 -0.50638,0.11632 -0.6875,0.30273l-15.29297,15.29297l-6.29297,-6.29297c-0.25082,-0.26124 -0.62327,-0.36647 -0.97371,-0.27511c-0.35044,0.09136 -0.62411,0.36503 -0.71547,0.71547c-0.09136,0.35044 0.01388,0.72289 0.27511,0.97371l7,7c0.39053,0.39037 1.02353,0.39037 1.41406,0l16,-16c0.29576,-0.28749 0.38469,-0.72707 0.22393,-1.10691c-0.16075,-0.37985 -0.53821,-0.62204 -0.9505,-0.60988z\">\n                                    </path>\n                                </g>\n                            </g>\n                        </svg>\n                        Get Notified for Your Backlinks Removals\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </main>\n\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Identify The Broken Internal Links&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p>A broken internal link indicates a link in the page that redirects to another page of the same website that doesn’t\n    exist. This issue is frequent on websites when it is re-designed. It is essential to audit the internal linking\n    strategies to identify the broken links &amp; fix them by using 301 permanent redirections to maintain a good SEO\n    performance.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img\n        src=\"https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Broken-Link.jpg\" alt=\"Broken Link\" class=\"wp-image-1633\"\n        style=\"width:801px;height:auto\" /></figure>\n\n<p>When a website is redesigned, or multiple developers work on it over a long period of time, the following issues can\n    occur:</p>\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n    <li>A webpage that is probably not important right now gets deleted, or the URL is changed for some reason.</li>\n\n    <li>Sometimes, the overall website’s URL structure can be altered, which can create a lot of broken links. However,\n        it should be avoided as changing the URL structure of the whole website would create a lot of broken links &amp;\n        it can ruin all your SEO work.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If you fail to resolve the broken internal link issue, then the 404 error or “page not found” error can occur, which\n    can affect the user experience.</p>\n\n<p>Also, During crawling, if a search bot repeatedly discovers broken links, it can negatively affect the speed or rate\n    at which the bots crawl your website, which would impact your indexing &amp; website’s organic ranking in the Search\n    Engine Result Pages (SERP).   </p>\n\n<p>After auditing the internal links, if you find any broken links, it’s important to remove them from the page, or you\n    can redirect the URL of the deleted page to a different page using the 301 permanent redirection method. </p>\n\n<p>Note: Too many permanent redirections can affect your SEO.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Find The Orphan Pages&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p>By auditing the internal links, you can unearth if there are any orphan pages on your website.</p>\n\n<p>An orphan page is created when a page has no internal links pointing to it. In other words, it has no parent pages.\n    Having too many orphan pages can become an issue for a website as it wastes the crawl budget of the search engine.\n    Also, in most cases, an orphan page does not rank well in organic searches. </p>\n\n<p>By finding the orphan pages of a website, you can add internal links to them, which can help to improve the page’s\n    ranking of the orphan page as Google bot can easily crawl and index the page’s content, improving the visibility of\n    the page. In addition, this would improve the website’s health too. </p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Find The Internal Linking Opportunities</h3>\n\n<p>When a new web page or blog post is published, finding internal linking opportunities is important to give it some\n    link juice from the right pages to help the page or blog post rank higher.</p>\n\n<p>By providing an internal link from a contextually similar page or blog post, you can significantly improve the page’s\n    ranking, which in turn can increase the page's organic traffic and page views. </p>\n\n<p>When you are running an agency, finding internal linking opportunities manually for each page is almost impossible,\n    and most of the tools cannot find internal linking opportunities to build incoming internal links or internal\n    backlinks to a page.</p>\n\n<p>While most website owners &amp; editors use Wordpress Plugins or internal link recommendations, those are mostly for\n    outgoing links from a page you are editing. Still, rarely would you come across a tool that suggests incoming\n    internal links to a page.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img\n        src=\"https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Interlinking-suggestion-1024x432.jpg\"\n        alt=\"Interlinking suggestion\" class=\"wp-image-1632\" /></figure>\n\n<p>Fortunately, Dofollo is here to create internal links a little bit easier. Doffolo shows you the internal link\n    opportunity for both incoming &amp; outgoing links for any given page on your website.</p>\n\n<p>With the help of AI, Dofollo suggests internal linking opportunities &amp; also allows you to place the links on your\n    website without having to open your website or navigate to the target page. If you would like to <a\n        href=\"https://dofollo.ai/blog/find-internal-links-any-page/#:~:text=and%20organic%20traffic.-,Finding%20Internal%20Links%20By%20Using%20Dofollo%C2%A0,-While%20the%20Google\">see\n        how Dofollo works, you can click here</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How To Find Internal Links To A Page&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>Let’s discover the three ways to find internal links efficiently and quickly:</p>\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n    <li><strong>Find the internal links using Ahref&nbsp;</strong></li>\n\n    <li><strong>Using Google Search Console&nbsp;</strong></li>\n\n    <li><strong>Find internal links by using Dofollo</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Find the Internal Links using Ahref</h3>\n\n<p>If you have enough time and aren’t ready to invest money in any SEO tools, then you can find the internal links\n    manually which includes a fair amount of effort.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Finding the internal links manually is a very simple process, but its time consuming. You just need to open the web\n    page or blog post and thoroughly go through it. When you encounter a link, you need to click on it and examine to\n    which page the link redirects you. To record the data, you can use Excel or Google Sheets. </p>\n\n<p>Manually finding the internal links can be a time-consuming process. Hence, to make this process easier, you can use\n    an SEO tool like <strong><a href=\"https://ahrefs.com/\">Ahrefs</a></strong>. Here, you can see the incoming and\n    outgoing links of a page.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img\n        src=\"https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ahref-incoming-1024x583.jpg\" alt=\"Ahref incoming\"\n        class=\"wp-image-1626\" style=\"width:639px;height:auto\" /></figure>\n\n<p>Here, you can see that Ahrefs only shows contextual links (not header, footer, etc), which is an additional advantage\n    of Ahrefs over our second tool, Google Search Console.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img\n        src=\"https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ahref-Outgoing-1024x578.jpg\" alt=\"Ahref Outgoing link\"\n        class=\"wp-image-1625\" style=\"object-fit:cover\" /></figure>\n\n<p>The caveat with Ahref is it is quite expensive &amp; it doesn't suggest you the link opportunities.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Search for Internal Links Using Google Search Console</h3>\n\n<p>Manually finding the internal links for a large website can be exhausting  &amp; Ahref is a premium tool with certain\n    limitations. If you are looking for a free tool, you can use the Google Search Console tool to find internal links\n    to any page of your website easily.</p>\n\n<p>If you already have added your website to the <a href=\"https://search.google.com/search-console/about\">Google Search\n        Console</a> tool, then you need to log in to your account and click on the ‘Links’ as shown in the image below.\n</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img\n        src=\"https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/links-1024x514.jpg\" alt=\"gsc check links\"\n        class=\"wp-image-1643\" /></figure>\n\n<p>in the GSC you can see the internal links and external links of a web page. However, the main drawback of the Google\n    Search Console tool is it shows you unnecessary links, including links that exist in the menus, footer tags, and\n    pagination which heavily inflate the number of links for each page.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img\n        src=\"https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GSC-Internal-link-and-external-links-1024x549.jpg\"\n        alt=\"GSC Internal link \" class=\"wp-image-1623\" /></figure>\n\n<p>In the above image, you can see the total internal links are 191 in Aherfs which includes links that exist in the\n    menus, footer tags, and pagination.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Apart from this, the Google Search Console tool has some more limitations. You can’t see the internal linking\n    opportunities which are needed to rank your web page or blog post at the top of the Search Engine Result Pages\n    (SERPs), which helps to increase the page views and organic traffic.  </p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Finding Internal Links By Using Dofollo&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\">While the Google Search Console &amp; Ahref has a\n        lot of limitations when it comes to internal links, using <a href=\"https://dofollo.ai/\" target=\"_blank\"\n            rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Dofollo</strong></a> can help you discover your current links, find new internal link\n        opportunities &amp; even help you add or remove the internal links to your website.</span></p>\n\n<p>Dofollo is built to manage internal links of websites.

A balanced on-page optimization should include creating relevant internal links\n    for your pages and blog posts for better SEO rankings.</p>\n\n<p>But how do you go about creating those internal links? Surely, it's more than just randomly stumbling upon keywords\n    and phrases on your pages &amp; linking them to other pages without any thoughts or a clear target.</p>\n\n<p>This type of stray link-building shows a clear lack of an internal link-building strategy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Internal link can give your content that extra bit of rocket fuel that helps it propel into the top of Google search\n    rankings, but only if it's done correctly.</p>\n\n<p>Here, we have curated a list of best practices for internal linking that helps you create internal links with a clear\n    aim to rank your target pages higher instead of just building random links &amp; praying to Google for that top\n    ranking.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Is An Internal Link?</h2>\n\n<p>Internal links are essentially bridges to another destination.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The idea of contextual internal links is to help the audience of your website or blog to find more information about\n    a topic, the page you are linking to should be a sub topic of your current page.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img\n        src=\"https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Internal-Linking.png\" alt=\"Example of Internal Linking \"\n        class=\"wp-image-1822\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Example of internal linking</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>Hence, you should only hyperlink to pages that add more value to your topic and not just add <a\n        href=\\\"https://dofollo.ai/blog/find-internal-links-any-page/\\\">internal links</a> for the sake of it.</p>\n\n<p>The bridge should take you to a different destination but that's related to your original location, it only retains\n    relevance if the destination is related to the origin.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Are Internal Links Important For SEO</h2>\n\n<p>SEO used to be all about the backlinks, adding some valuable backlinks used to give the deceased results. Today's SEO\n    is a far cry from it.</p>\n\n<p>But, the backlinks still carry the most value. Content is the king, but there’s still a kingmaker.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Document\n\n\n\n\n    <main style=\"display:flex;justify-content:center;\">\n        <div class=\"main-card-for-some\">\n            <div>\n                <h1 class=\"heading-card\">Manage Your <span class=\"h1-span\">Internal Links</span><br>\n                    with AI for Better SEO Rankings</h1>\n                <div class=\"up-mt-1\">\n                    <a href=\"https://linke.to/jbhj\" class=\"btn-blue\">Check Your Internal Links</a>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"card-caption-body\">\n                    <div class=\"card-caption-text\">\n                        <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\" width=\"10\" height=\"10\"\n                            viewBox=\"0,0,256,256\">\n                            <g fill=\"#007CFE\" fill-rule=\"nonzero\" stroke=\"none\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-linecap=\"butt\"\n                                stroke-linejoin=\"miter\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-dasharray=\"\" stroke-dashoffset=\"0\"\n                                font-family=\"none\" font-weight=\"none\" font-size=\"none\" text-anchor=\"none\"\n                                style=\"mix-blend-mode: normal\">\n                                <g transform=\"scale(8.53333,8.53333)\">\n                                    <path\n                                        d=\"M26.98047,5.99023c-0.2598,0.00774 -0.50638,0.11632 -0.6875,0.30273l-15.29297,15.29297l-6.29297,-6.29297c-0.25082,-0.26124 -0.62327,-0.36647 -0.97371,-0.27511c-0.35044,0.09136 -0.62411,0.36503 -0.71547,0.71547c-0.09136,0.35044 0.01388,0.72289 0.27511,0.97371l7,7c0.39053,0.39037 1.02353,0.39037 1.41406,0l16,-16c0.29576,-0.28749 0.38469,-0.72707 0.22393,-1.10691c-0.16075,-0.37985 -0.53821,-0.62204 -0.9505,-0.60988z\">\n                                    </path>\n                                </g>\n                            </g>\n                        </svg>\n                        No Technical Knowledge Required\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"card-caption-text\">\n                        <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\" width=\"10\" height=\"10\"\n                            viewBox=\"0,0,256,256\">\n                            <g fill=\"#007CFE\" fill-rule=\"nonzero\" stroke=\"none\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-linecap=\"butt\"\n                                stroke-linejoin=\"miter\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-dasharray=\"\" stroke-dashoffset=\"0\"\n                                font-family=\"none\" font-weight=\"none\" font-size=\"none\" text-anchor=\"none\"\n                                style=\"mix-blend-mode: normal\">\n                                <g transform=\"scale(8.53333,8.53333)\">\n                                    <path\n                                        d=\"M26.98047,5.99023c-0.2598,0.00774 -0.50638,0.11632 -0.6875,0.30273l-15.29297,15.29297l-6.29297,-6.29297c-0.25082,-0.26124 -0.62327,-0.36647 -0.97371,-0.27511c-0.35044,0.09136 -0.62411,0.36503 -0.71547,0.71547c-0.09136,0.35044 0.01388,0.72289 0.27511,0.97371l7,7c0.39053,0.39037 1.02353,0.39037 1.41406,0l16,-16c0.29576,-0.28749 0.38469,-0.72707 0.22393,-1.10691c-0.16075,-0.37985 -0.53821,-0.62204 -0.9505,-0.60988z\">\n                                    </path>\n                                </g>\n                            </g>\n                        </svg>\n                        Get Notified for Your Backlinks Removals\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </main>\n\n\n\n\n<p>You can still get that vote of confidence from valuable websites and rank very well.

This is probably the easiest as most of you probably\n    already have the page in mind. But here are a few things you should keep in mind when showing the target page.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n    <li>The Page should be relevant to the central theme of your website. If you do not have pages that are relevant to\n        your target page, you will not have any pages to link from.</li>\n\n    <li>The keywords or phrases you are trying to rank for should be within means; do not go for keywords that are very\n        hard to rank for.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Discover High Authority Page To Build Internal Links.</h3>\n\n<p>To rank higher, you need links from valuable pages. One way to find valuable pages is to find high-authority pages\n    that are also semantically close to your target page.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img\n        src=\"https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Page-Authority-1024x535.png\" alt=\"High Authority Page \"\n        class=\"wp-image-1815\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Visualization of page authority</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>You can use tools like&nbsp;Ahref and&nbsp;SEMRush to find pages with the most backlinks, but for the purpose of this\n    demonstration, we would use the Google Search Console Tool as the tool of our choice to find pages with the most\n    backlinks.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How To Find High Authority Pages on Google Search Console Tool?</h3>\n\n<p>On your Google Search Console, locate the “Links” option on the left-hand menu. This would show you both the internal\n    link &amp; external links.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img\n        src=\"https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Internal-links-checked-by-GSC-Links-section.png\"\n        alt=\"Internal links checked through GSC Links section\" class=\"wp-image-1807\" style=\"object-fit:cover\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>GSC Links section overview, showing internal and external link\n            analysis,</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>Under internal links, you will find the “Top linked pages externally” Click on the “more” option under the initial\n    list.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img\n        src=\"https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GSC-Internal-link-section-check-more.png\"\n        alt=\"Internal links for detailed insights in the GSC Links section\" class=\"wp-image-1809\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Internal links for detailed insights in the GSC links section</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>This would open the list of pages with their number of backlinks mentioned on the right.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img\n        src=\"https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Top-Internal-Linked-Pages-by-GSC.png\"\n        alt=\"Top Internal Linked Pages by GSC\" class=\"wp-image-1810\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Top Internal Linked Pages report in Google Search Console</em>\n    </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>You also have the option to export the report, from there you can find the pages that are relevant to your target\n    page &amp; sort them according to their number of backlinks if your donor list is sizable.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Build Internal Links on Pages With Organic Traffic</h3>\n\n<p>Another way to find a list of your prospective donor pages for your internal links is to find pages on your website\n    that already have some organic traffic to it.</p>\n\n<p>Pages with organic traffic are great indicators of value. If Google is ranking your page high enough to get organic\n    clicks it is assigning the age some authority.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img\n        src=\"https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Organic-Search-.png\"\n        alt=\"Organic search results by Google analytics\" class=\"wp-image-1811\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Organic search results overview in Google Analytics</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>You can not only distribute that page authority to semantically related pages on your website, but internal links on\n    pages with organic traffic also divert real users to your target pages.</p>\n\n<p>This flow of real visitors is a strong ranking signal for Google's search ranking algorithm.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How To Find Pages With Organic Traffic on Google Search Console Tool?</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ensure The Semantic Relation Between Pages</h3>\n\n<p>Once you have the list of prospect keywords ready, you need to open them on your browser one by one and make sure the\n    topic of your target page is really relevant to the donor page.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Document\n\n\n\n\n    <main style=\"display:flex;justify-content:center;\">\n        <div class=\"main-card-for-some\">\n            <div>\n                <h1

Ideall,y your anchor\n    texts should describe the content of your target page.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img\n        src=\"https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Descriptive-anchor-text.png\"\n        alt=\"Descriptive anchor text\" class=\"wp-image-1812\" style=\"object-fit:cover\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Example of descriptive anchor text</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>This linking style helps both search engines and your audience understand the context of your target page, which is\n    great for your user experience.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid building internal links with just one of two words as their anchor text.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Choose A Contrasting Hyperlink Text Color</h3>\n\n<p>Building internal links is not just for SEO ranking; it also helps your users to find valuable information on your\n    website.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure your internal link stands out from the regular text well enough so your audience can visually distinguish\n    them while scanning the webpage, even on a mobile device.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img\n        src=\"https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Contrasting-hyperlink-text-color.png\"\n        alt=\"Contrasting hyperlink text color\" class=\"wp-image-1816\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Example of contrasting hyperlink text color</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>A good practice is to make the color of your hyperlink to the main theme color of your website, here are some great\n    examples of this.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n    <li><a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/\">neilpatel.com</a></li>\n\n    <li><a href=\"https://semrush.com\">semrush.com</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This contrast of your hyperlinks looks great, and they improve the click-through rate of your internal links.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Limit The Number Of Link In A Page</h3>\n\n<p>Internal links are great for improving the ranking of your pages, but they should be built in moderation.</p>\n\n<p>You wouldn’t want to build too many of them as that would dilute their link juice, having too many links from a page\n    would reduce the average influence of each internal link from that Page.</p>\n\n<details class=\"wp-block-details has-text-color has-link-color has-medium-font-size\" style=\"color:#326750\">\n    <summary>How Many Internal Links Is Too Many?</summary>\n    <p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">But how many is too many? Well, for internal links, most SEO experts recommend\n        sticking below internal links per to words. But, most bigger well-known blogs usually build more internal links,\n        especially on older blog posts.</p>\n\n    <p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><br>If you are not sure what limit you should set for yourself, you can use Dofollo\n        to check the behemoths, your competitors or the page ranking at the top of Google search and see how many\n        internal links they are adding to their blogs.</p>\n</details>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Avoid No-follow Links</h3>\n\n<p>Conventional wisdom is, Do-follow links pass link juice as well as navigating the user while No-follow links do not\n    pass the link authority, they are used for navigational purposes.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img\n        src=\"https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Nofollow-Tag.png\" alt=\"Nofollow Tag\"\n        class=\"wp-image-1817\" style=\"object-fit:cover\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Example of the 'nofollow' tag in use</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>While, If No-Follow has zero link authority or lower link authority could be up for debate, it is best to avoid the\n    no-follow when building internal links.</p>\n\n<details class=\"wp-block-details has-text-color has-link-color has-medium-font-size\" style=\"color:#326750\">\n    <summary>How to build dofollow links?</summary>\n    <p>All links that you create through the WordPress editor are dofollow by default unless you add the nofollow tag.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>Nofollow links have specified it by adding a “nofollow” tag.</p>\n</details>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Add External Links</h3>\n\n<p>Links help your pages to rank, but it's not just limited to backlinks and internal links.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>External links, too, can help you rank your pages. This might seem counterintuitive but a meaningful external link\n    that elevates user experience does help you rank higher.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img\n        src=\"https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/External-links--1024x535.png\"\n        alt=\"count of external links in dofollo tools\" class=\"wp-image-1818\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Visualization of the count of external links using dofollo tools</em>\n    </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>But what kind of external links should you build?

Similar to SEO, building and managing internal\n    links is an ongoing process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>You would need to audit internal links of your website on a regular interval to make sure your internal link game is\n    at par with other SEO efforts and to make sure you are fully utilizing your internal linking opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>Creating new links and deleting unnecessary links that do not align with your business or revenue goal anymore are\n    all part of it.</p>\n\n<p>Apart from these auditing your internal link also allows you to do the following.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Fix Broken Links</h3>\n\n<p>If you are managing bigger websites or managing a plethora of websites, finding those broken links might become a\n    painful task. This is especially true if you are running an agency and your client's website has been managed by\n    other agencies and freelancers in the past.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img src=\"https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Broken-Links.png\"\n        alt=\"Fix Broken Links\" class=\"wp-image-1820\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Example of broken links</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>Finding those broken links and fixing them might resolve a lot of SEO-related issues on your website.</p>\n\n<p>But you need a reliable tool to find those broken pages. Maybe you have access to those tools, too, but replacing\n    them is a very time-consuming task. You can now make it smooth and fast with Dofollo.</p>\n\n<p>Dofollo would not only show the broken links to you but also help you replace or remove them.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Fix Orphan Pages</h3>\n\n<p>Orphan pages are not good for SEO; they hurt your SEO. They usually never rank for organic keywords, and having them\n    on your website doesn’t make a lot of sense. But it might not always be possible to get rid of those pages.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img\n        src=\"https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Orphan-pages-1.png\" alt=\"Orphan pages\"\n        class=\"wp-image-1821\" style=\"object-fit:cover\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Visualization of Orphan Pages</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>Dofollo allows you to find those orphan pages and link them to other pages on your website that are contextually\n    similar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Eliminating the orphan pages would help your website in the long run.</p>\n\n<p>I have mentioned the best practices here, and this list would certainly help you improve your on page SEO, but I kept\n    the most important of them for the end.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Start Building Internal Links Now.</h2>\n\n<p>Knowledge is power only when you apply your knowledge.

            "content": "<p>Modern SEO is no longer just about keywords and backlinks. It focuses heavily on user experience (UX), and one of the\n    most underrated yet powerful elements of UX is readability.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In fact, Google’s algorithms are increasingly designed to prioritize content that humans find easy to consume. But\n    how exactly does readability affect SEO? And how can you optimize your content to boost both your rankings and\n    engagement?</p>\n\n<p>The Dofollo team has curated this comprehensive guide to help you understand why readability matters and how to\n    implement it effectively.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">What is Readability?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>Readability is a measure of how easy it is for a reader to understand a written text. It’s determined by several\n    factors, including:</p>\n\n<ul class=\\\"wp-block-list\\\">\n    <li><strong>Sentence Complexity:</strong> Are the sentences short and punchy or long and convoluted?</li>\n\n    <li><strong>Vocabulary Choice:</strong> Are you using simple, common words or jargon and industry-speak?</li>\n\n    <li><strong>Formatting:</strong> Is the text broken up with headings, lists, and images, or is it a “wall of text”?\n    </li>\n\n    <li><strong>Visual Elements:</strong> Are you using fonts, line spacing, and contrasting colors that make reading\n        painless?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">How Readability Affects SEO: The Indirect Impact&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>While readability isn’t a direct ranking factor (like page speed or mobile-friendliness), it significantly impacts\n    the metrics that Google <em>does</em> use to judge content quality.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">1. Bounce Rate and Dwell Time&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p>If a visitor lands on your page and is hit with a giant block of difficult text, they’re likely to “bounce” back to\n    the search results. Google notices this. A high bounce rate combined with low dwell time (the time spent on a page)\n    signals to Google that your content didn’t satisfy the user’s intent, which can lead to lower rankings.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">2. Improved Indexing and Crawling&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p>Clear, easy-to-read content often follows a logical structure with proper header tags (H1, H2, H3). This structure\n    helps search engine spiders crawl and understand your content more efficiently, making it easier for Google to rank\n    you for the right keywords.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">3. Voice Search Optimization&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p>As voice search becomes more prevalent, readability is more important than ever. Voice search queries are typically\n    conversational. Content that flows naturally and is easy to read aloud is much more likely to be featured in voice\n    search results.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">4. Increased Backlinks and Social Shares&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p>People share content they understand and find valuable. If your guide or article is easy to digest, other sites are\n    more likely to link to it as a resource, and your audience is more likely to share it on social media. This builds\n    the authority (E-E-A-T) that Google loves.</p>\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\n\\n\\n\n    \\n\\n\n    \\n\\n Document\\n\\n \\n\\n\n\\n\\n\n\n\\n\\n <main style=\\\"display: flex; justify-content: center\\\">\\n\\n <div class=\\\"main-card-for-some\\\">\\n\\n <div>\\n\\n\n                <h1 class=\\\"heading-card\\\">\\n\\n Manage Your <span class=\\\"h1-span\\\">Internal Links</span><br />\\n\\n with\n                    AI for Better SEO Rankings\\n\\n </h1>\\n\\n <div class=\\\"up-mt-1\\\">\\n\\n <a\n                        href=\\\"https://linke.to/jbhj\\\" class=\\\"btn-blue\\\"\\n\\n>Check Your Internal Links</a\\n\\n>\\n\\n\n                </div>\\n\\n <div class=\\\"card-caption-body\\\">\\n\\n <div class=\\\"card-caption-text\\\">\\n\\n <svg\\n\\n\n                            xmlns=\\\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\\\"\\n\\n x=\\\"0px\\\"\\n\\n y=\\\"0px\\\"\\n\\n width=\\\"10\\\"\\n\\n\n                            height=\\\"10\\\"\\n\\n viewBox=\\\"0,0,256,256\\\"\\n\\n>\\n\\n <g\\n\\n fill=\\\"#007CFE\\\"\\n\\n\n                                fill-rule=\\\"nonzero\\\"\\n\\n stroke=\\\"none\\\"\\n\\n stroke-width=\\\"1\\\"\\n\\n\n                                stroke-linecap=\\\"butt\\\"\\n\\n stroke-linejoin=\\\"miter\\\"\\n\\n stroke-miterlimit=\\\"10\\\"\\n\\n\n                                stroke-dasharray=\\\"\\\"\\n\\n stroke-dashoffset=\\\"0\\\"\\n\\n font-weight=\\\"none\\\"\\n\\n\n                                font-size=\\\"none\\\"\\n\\n text-anchor=\\\"none\\\"\\n\\n style=\\\"mix-blend-mode: normal\\\"\\n\\n>\n                                \\n\\n <g transform=\\\"scale(8.53333,8.53333)\\\">\\n\\n <path\\n\\n\n                                        d=\\\"M26.98047,5.99023c-0.2598,0.00774 -0.50638,0.11632\n                                        -0.6875,0.30273l-15.29297,15.29297l-6.29297,-6.29297c-0.25082,-0.26124\n                                        -0.62327,-0.36647 -0.97371,-0.27511c-0.35044,0.09136 -0.62411,0.36503\n                                        -0.71547,0.71547c-0.09136,0.35044 0.01388,0.72289\n                                        0.27511,0.97371l7,7c0.39053,0.39037 1.02353,0.39037\n                                        1.41406,0l16,-16c0.29576,-0.28749 0.38469,-0.72707\n                                        0.22393,-1.10691c-0.16075,-0.37985 -0.53821,-0.62204 -0.9505,-0.60988z\\\"\\n\\n>\n                                        </path>\\n\\n </g>\\n\\n </g>\\n\\n </svg>\\n\\n No Technical Knowledge Required\\n\\n\n                    </div>\\n\\n <div class=\\\"card-caption-text\\\">\\n\\n <svg\\n\\n xmlns=\\\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\\\"\\n\\n\n                            x=\\\"0px\\\"\\n\\n y=\\\"0px\\\"\\n\\n width=\\\"10\\\"\\n\\n height=\\\"10\\\"\\n\\n viewBox=\\\"0,0,256,256\\\"\\n\\n>\n                            \\n\\n <g\\n\\n fill=\\\"#007CFE\\\"\\n\\n fill-rule=\\\"nonzero\\\"\\n\\n stroke=\\\"none\\\"\\n\\n\n                                stroke-width=\\\"1\\\"\\n\\n stroke-linecap=\\\"butt\\\"\\n\\n stroke-linejoin=\\\"miter\\\"\\n\\n\n                                stroke-miterlimit=\\\"10\\\"\\n\\n stroke-dasharray=\\\"\\\"\\n\\n stroke-dashoffset=\\\"0\\\"\\n\\n\n                                font-weight=\\\"none\\\"\\n\\n font-size=\\\"none\\\"\\n\\n text-anchor=\\\"none\\\"\\n\\n\n                                style=\\\"mix-blend-mode: normal\\\"\\n\\n>\\n\\n <g transform=\\\"scale(8.53333,8.53333)\\\">\\n\\n\n                                    <path\\n\\n d=\\\"M26.98047,5.99023c-0.2598,0.00774 -0.50638,0.11632\n                                        -0.6875,0.30273l-15.29297,15.29297l-6.29297,-6.29297c-0.25082,-0.26124\n                                        -0.62327,-0.36647 -0.97371,-0.27511c-0.35044,0.09136 -0.62411,0.36503\n                                        -0.71547,0.71547c-0.09136,0.35044 0.01388,0.72289\n                                        0.27511,0.97371l7,7c0.39053,0.39037 1.02353,0.39037\n                                        1.41406,0l16,-16c0.29576,-0.28749 0.38469,-0.72707\n                                        0.22393,-1.10691c-0.16075,-0.37985 -0.53821,-0.62204 -0.9505,-0.60988z\\\"\\n\\n>\n                                        </path>\\n\\n </g>\\n\\n </g>\\n\\n </svg>\\n\\n Get Notified for Your Backlinks\n                                Removals\\n\\n </div>\\n\\n </div>\\n\\n </div>\\n\\n </div>\\n\\n </main>\\n\\n \\n\\n\n\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Top Readability Best Practices&nbsp;</h2>\\n\\n<p>Now that we know <em>why</em>\n    it matters, let’s look at <em>how</em> to optimize your content for readability. Follow these best practices to\n    ensure your content is as accessible as possible.</p>\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">1. Use Short Sentences and\n    Paragraphs&nbsp;</h3>\\n\\n<p>Long sentences are hard to follow. Aim for an average of 15 to 20 words per sentence.\n    Similarly, keep your paragraphs short. Each paragraph should focus on a single idea and shouldn’t exceed 3 or 4\n    sentences. White space is your friend!</p>\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">2. Write for an 8th-Grade Level&nbsp;\n</h3>\\n\\n<p>Even if your audience is highly academic, they will still appreciate simple, clear writing. Tools like the\n    <strong>Flesch-Kincaid Readability Score</strong> can help you measure this. Writing at an 8th-grade level makes\n    your content accessible to the widest possible audience without sacrificing quality.</p>\\n\\n<h3\n    class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">3. Break it Up with Headings and Subheadings&nbsp;</h3>\\n\\n<p>Headings acts as a roadmap\n    for your readers. Use H1 for your title, H2 for main sections, and H3 for subsections. This allows readers to scan\n    your content and find exactly what they’re looking for.</p>\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">4. Use Bullet Points\n    and Numbered Lists&nbsp;</h3>\\n\\n<p>Lists are incredibly easy to scan. Whenever you have a series of items, steps,\n    or features, use a list instead of a comma-heavy sentence. This makes the information pop and is much easier to\n    digest.</p>\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">5. Use High-Contrast Colors and Large Fonts&nbsp;</h3>\\n\\n<p>\n    Readability isn’t just about the words; it’s about the visual experience. Use dark text on a light background (or\n    vice versa) and ensure your font size is large enough to read comfortably on mobile devices (at least 16px).&nbsp;\n</p>\\n\\n<h3 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">6. Add Relevant Images and Media&nbsp;</h3>\\n\\n<p>Images, infographics, and\n    videos act as visual breaks in your text. They not only make the content more engaging but also help illustrate\n    complex points in a simpler way.</p>\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Don’t Forget Internal Linking!&nbsp;</h2>\\n\\n\n<p>A well-structured internal linking strategy further enhances readability by providing a clear path for users to\n    discover more related content. If a user finds a term they don’t understand, or wants to dive deeper into a specific\n    subtopic, an <a href=\\\"https://dofollo.ai/blog/what-is-dofollo/\\\">internal link </a>is the perfect guide.</p>\\n\\n<p>\n    Using a tool like <strong>Dofollo</strong> makes this part easy.
