            },
            {
                "question": "Why should I use a link counter?",
                "answer": "Counting links helps in auditing your on-page SEO. Too many links can dilute your page authority, while too few might affect user navigation. It also helps identify broken links or excessive external linking."
            },
            {
                "question": "How does the tool count links?",

            {
                "question": "What is a counter link tool used for?",

            {
                "question": "Can this tool count internal and external links?",

            {
                "question": "Does the tool count external and outbound links?",
                "answer": "Yes, 'external' and 'outbound' links are terms often used interchangeably. The tool counts any link pointing to a different domain."
            },
            {
                "question": "Is this link counter free to use?",

            },
            {
                "question": "Why is counting links important for SEO?",
                "answer": "Search engines use links to crawl and understand your site. A balanced link count ensures efficient crawling and prevents 'link juice' dilution."
            },

                "question": "Can I use this tool for long pages?",
