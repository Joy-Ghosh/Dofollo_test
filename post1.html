<p>As an SEO professional, you understand how important an internal linking strategy is for your organic rankings. However, planning and implementing an internal linking strategy could be a time-consuming endeavor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fortunately, Dofollo is here to help you build and implement your internal linking strategy on any website with ease.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are running an SEO agency or working as a freelancer, you don’t want to spend a lot of time doing the grunt work of auditing your internal links &amp; finding new internal link oppertunities. You need an SEO tool that will help you implement the internal linking strategy efficiently and not make you do a lot of unwanted, time-consuming, and mind-numbing tasks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/dofollo-dashboard-1024x508.jpg" alt="dofollo dashboard" class="wp-image-1594" style="object-fit:cover"/></figure>

<p>There are a few tools are available that promise to help with the internal linking process, but most of them are mainly focused on checking keyword positions rather than on the internal link-building strategy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, using Aherfs or Google Search Console tools can help you find your existing internal links to some extent. However, they have limitations, as they do not fare very twell when it comes to finding internal linking opportunities and adding those links to the your website website is a manual &amp; tidious task.</p>

<p>If you have a WordPress website, there are some plugins available in the WordPress ecosystem which helps you with the internal linking oppertunities. However, these plugins can only suggest the outgoing link from a page you are currently working on. This can be challenging for building a strong internal linking strategy, as you can’t see any suggestions for incoming links, especially when you are publishing a spanking new blog post.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dofollo can reduce your headache by making this internal link-building process much easier. Dofollo gives you a top-level view of your current <a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/internal-links/">internal links</a> and shows you new internal link oppertunities based on AI recommendations for building more internal links.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, Dofollo allow you the qnique ability to add the newly planned linked to your website from the Dofollo console itself without having to visit your website, and that too with the right anchor text.</p>

Dofollo AI will suggest internal linking opportunities to improve your ranking in Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

But if you have to do this 20/30 times for a day or maybe for 20/30 websites it consumes a lot more energy than what we would like to admin.</p>
