<p>As an SEO expert, you know how crucial your internal linking strategy can be. But to implement an internal linking
    strategy you must be able to see the existing internal links to your target page.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But if you are working on a website with a lot of pages, it could be an overwhelming task to find internal links that
    already exist to your target page.</p>

<p>As a digital marketing agency owner or a freelancer, time is money, and you don't wanna spend it on trying to
    discover all current internal links. You need the process to be easy to conserve your time &amp; energy, so you can
    spend it on more fruitful endeavours like building your internal link strategy &amp; finally implementing the links
    on the website.</p>

<p>Auditing the internal links that are already present on the website &amp; discovering new internal linking
    opportunities for a freshly published blog post or even an old webpage need not take up all of your time dedicated
    to optimizing the website.</p>

<p>We would show you 3 different ways you can audit your website easily to find all the internal links to any page you
    are working on so you can spend your time doing more rewarding SEO tasks that can result in your website achieving a
    higher ranking in Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs). </p>

<p>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Understanding Internal Linking With An Example</h2>

<p>In simple terms, internal links indicate the hyperlinks that can redirect visitors &amp; search engine bots to
    different pages in the same website or domain. For example adding the below line of code in the &lt;body> of the
    HTML file of a page, you would create an internal link from that page to the Minify CSS Article page. </p>

<pre
    class="wp-block-code language-html"><code><strong>&lt;a href=\"https://rabbitloader.com/articles/minify-css//\"&gt;adding an internal link&lt;/a&gt;</strong></code></pre>

<p>In the example of the above is a dofollow link, the target page is
    <strong>https://rabbitloader.com/articles/minify-css//</strong> and <strong>adding an internal link</strong> is the
    anchor text. However, to add the nofollow link, you need to follow the below syntax:</p>

<pre
    class="wp-block-code language-html"><code><strong>&lt;a href=\"https://rabbitloader.com/articles/minify-css//\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;How to blog&lt;/a&gt;</strong></code></pre>

<p>Adding rel=\"nofollow \"within the Ahref tag would turn the link into a no-follow link.</p>

<p>The key goal of building an effective internal linking strategy is to pass the page’s authority to a low-ranking
    pag,e which can help the web page rank higher in Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs). Let’s understand the internal
    links with an example. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img
        src="https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Interlinking-example.jpg" alt="Interlinking example"
        class="wp-image-1630" style="width:778px;height:auto" /></figure>

<p><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Assume you have clicked the link
        “<strong>Interaction to Next Paint</strong>” on the <strong>Minify CSS</strong> blog post on
        RabbitLoader.com.</span> It would redirect you to the INP page which is within the RabbitLoader website. This
    kind of hyperlink is known as an internal link. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the link points to a web page of a different website or domain instead of the same website,
    it is known as an external link.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Importance Of Internal Links in SEO</h2>

<p>If you are following SEO trends, you would realize lately the trend has been to focus on a robust internal linking
    strategy. But the expert SEOs have been doing this for years now.</p>

<p>Let’s concentrate on the importance of building a strong internal linking strategy:&nbsp;</p>

<ol class="wp-block-list">
    <li><strong>A strong internal linking strategy helps pass the page authority/ link equity.</strong></li>

    <li><strong>A well-structured internal linking strategy improves the crawling and indexing of your website.</strong>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Providing relevant internal links can increase a website’s average on-page time.</strong></li>
</ol>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A Strong Internal Linking Strategy Helps to Pass the Page Authority / Link
    Equity&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Google developed E-E-A-T to help you establish a page with a higher ranking potential where ”A” stands for
    Authoritativeness. Links from authority pages boost your organic ranking &amp; help you read the summit of the
    SERPs.</p>

<p>Getting authoritative backlinks is not only difficult, but it would also be a costly affair. While getting
    authoritative internal links from your website is within your control &amp; doesn't need you to spend any money.</p>

<p>Let’s easily understand this. If we go by the logic, if a page is ranking on top of a Google search result, it has
    the highest authority among all the competing pages now this could be for various reasons. Still, whatever the
    reason is, since it ranks on top, google assigns the top most value to it among the competing pages.</p>

<p>Since, having a higher SEO ranking indicates the web page has some authority. Backlinking from this page to a newly
    published blog post can improve the link equity of the newly published blog. Here, you are passing on some authority
    to the newly published blog through an internal link, given the new blog post is contextually somewhat similar.</p>

<p>Adding internal backlinks from the blog, which is already ranking well in Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs), can
    pass the page authority or link equity, which might improve the ranking of the newly published blog. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A Well-Structured Internal Linking Strategy Improves the Crawling and Indexing of a website
</h3>

<p>In order to determine the ranking of a web page in SERPs, first a search bot needs to crawl the web page and index
    the page. A strong, well-structured internal linking strategy can generate a pathway that leads a search bot to
    crawl and index the page’s content more frequently.</p>

<p>Especially when a website has a limited crawl budget (how many pages a search engine can crawl within a given time
    period), building an internal linking strategy would improve the indexing time. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Providing Relevant Internal Links Can Increase a Website’s Average On-Page Time.</h3>

<p>Providing the relevant internal links on a page can enhance the user experience. Users would find it easier to find
    the content that they are actually looking for, which can engage the user with the website’s content for a longer
    time.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img
        src="https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Average-On-Page-Time-1024x438.jpg"
        alt="Average On-Page Time" class="wp-image-1634" /></figure>

<p>Average on-page time indicates the span of time a user spends on a website. Engaging the user with the website’s
    content can significantly improve the website’s on-page time, which in turn can also help you build trust &amp;
    loyalty with the visitors &amp; help you achieve a desirable conversion rate.   </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Do You Need To Find The Internal Links To A Page</h2>

<p>To improve something, you should be able to measure it &amp; see the current status. It is the same when implementing
    an internal link strategy. You would need to know how many internal links your target page is getting, check if they
    are contextually similar or not, this top level view would allow you to take educated decision rather than blindly
    adding a bunch of internal link to a page you wish to rank o google.</p>

<p>Here are 4 reasons to find internal links to the page before implementing a link building strategy.</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li><strong>Plan implementation of internal linking strategy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></li>

    <li><strong>Identify the broken internal links</strong></li>

    <li><strong>Find the orphan pages&nbsp;</strong></li>

    <li><strong>Find the internal linking opportunities&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Plan Implementation of Internal Linking Strategy&nbsp;</h3>

<p>By auditing the internal links of a web page, you can visualize all internal links of the pages. It helps you easily
    determine If you need to add more links for a better ranking in Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs). In addition,
    with the help of internal link auditing, you can identify and remove if there's any wrong or unnecessary internal
    links already present on the page.  </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Identify The Broken Internal Links&nbsp;</h3>

<p>A broken internal link indicates a link in the page that redirects to another page of the same website that doesn’t
    exist. This issue is frequent on websites when it is re-designed. It is essential to audit the internal linking
    strategies to identify the broken links &amp; fix them by using 301 permanent redirections to maintain a good SEO
    performance.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img
        src="https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Broken-Link.jpg" alt="Broken Link" class="wp-image-1633"
        style="width:801px;height:auto" /></figure>

<p>When a website is redesigned, or multiple developers work on it over a long period of time, the following issues can
    occur:</p>

<ol class="wp-block-list">
    <li>A webpage that is probably not important right now gets deleted, or the URL is changed for some reason.</li>

    <li>Sometimes, the overall website’s URL structure can be altered, which can create a lot of broken links. However,
        it should be avoided as changing the URL structure of the whole website would create a lot of broken links &amp;
        it can ruin all your SEO work.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>If you fail to resolve the broken internal link issue, then the 404 error or “page not found” error can occur, which
    can affect the user experience.</p>

<p>Also, During crawling, if a search bot repeatedly discovers broken links, it can negatively affect the speed or rate
    at which the bots crawl your website, which would impact your indexing &amp; website’s organic ranking in the Search
    Engine Result Pages (SERP).   </p>

<p>After auditing the internal links, if you find any broken links, it’s important to remove them from the page, or you
    can redirect the URL of the deleted page to a different page using the 301 permanent redirection method. </p>

<p>Note: Too many permanent redirections can affect your SEO.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Find The Orphan Pages&nbsp;</h3>

<p>By auditing the internal links, you can unearth if there are any orphan pages on your website.</p>

<p>An orphan page is created when a page has no internal links pointing to it. In other words, it has no parent pages.
    Having too many orphan pages can become an issue for a website as it wastes the crawl budget of the search engine.
    Also, in most cases, an orphan page does not rank well in organic searches. </p>

<p>By finding the orphan pages of a website, you can add internal links to them, which can help to improve the page’s
    ranking of the orphan page as Google bot can easily crawl and index the page’s content, improving the visibility of
    the page. In addition, this would improve the website’s health too. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Find The Internal Linking Opportunities</h3>

<p>When a new web page or blog post is published, finding internal linking opportunities is important to give it some
    link juice from the right pages to help the page or blog post rank higher.</p>

<p>By providing an internal link from a contextually similar page or blog post, you can significantly improve the page’s
    ranking, which in turn can increase the page's organic traffic and page views. </p>

<p>When you are running an agency, finding internal linking opportunities manually for each page is almost impossible,
    and most of the tools cannot find internal linking opportunities to build incoming internal links or internal
    backlinks to a page.</p>

<p>While most website owners &amp; editors use Wordpress Plugins or internal link recommendations, those are mostly for
    outgoing links from a page you are editing. Still, rarely would you come across a tool that suggests incoming
    internal links to a page.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How To Find Internal Links To A Page&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Let’s discover the three ways to find internal links efficiently and quickly:</p>

<ol class="wp-block-list">
    <li><strong>Find the internal links using Ahref&nbsp;</strong></li>

    <li><strong>Using Google Search Console&nbsp;</strong></li>

    <li><strong>Find internal links by using Dofollo</strong></li>
</ol>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Find the Internal Links using Ahref</h3>

<p>If you have enough time and aren’t ready to invest money in any SEO tools, then you can find the internal links
    manually which includes a fair amount of effort.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finding the internal links manually is a very simple process, but its time consuming. You just need to open the web
    page or blog post and thoroughly go through it. When you encounter a link, you need to click on it and examine to
    which page the link redirects you. To record the data, you can use Excel or Google Sheets. </p>

<p>Manually finding the internal links can be a time-consuming process. Hence, to make this process easier, you can use
    an SEO tool like <strong><a href="https://ahrefs.com/">Ahrefs</a></strong>. Here, you can see the incoming and
    outgoing links of a page.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img
        src="https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ahref-incoming-1024x583.jpg" alt="Ahref incoming"
        class="wp-image-1626" style="width:639px;height:auto" /></figure>

<p>Here, you can see that Ahrefs only shows contextual links (not header, footer, etc), which is an additional advantage
    of Ahrefs over our second tool, Google Search Console.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img
        src="https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ahref-Outgoing-1024x578.jpg" alt="Ahref Outgoing link"
        class="wp-image-1625" style="object-fit:cover" /></figure>

<p>The caveat with Ahref is it is quite expensive &amp; it doesn't suggest you the link opportunities.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Search for Internal Links Using Google Search Console</h3>

<p>Manually finding the internal links for a large website can be exhausting  &amp; Ahref is a premium tool with certain
    limitations. If you are looking for a free tool, you can use the Google Search Console tool to find internal links
    to any page of your website easily.</p>

<p>If you already have added your website to the <a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/about">Google Search
        Console</a> tool, then you need to log in to your account and click on the ‘Links’ as shown in the image below.
</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img
        src="https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/links-1024x514.jpg" alt="gsc check links"
        class="wp-image-1643" /></figure>

<p>in the GSC you can see the internal links and external links of a web page. However, the main drawback of the Google
    Search Console tool is it shows you unnecessary links, including links that exist in the menus, footer tags, and
    pagination which heavily inflate the number of links for each page.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img
        src="https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GSC-Internal-link-and-external-links-1024x549.jpg"
        alt="GSC Internal link " class="wp-image-1623" /></figure>

<p>In the above image, you can see the total internal links are 191 in Aherfs which includes links that exist in the
    menus, footer tags, and pagination.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apart from this, the Google Search Console tool has some more limitations. You can’t see the internal linking
    opportunities which are needed to rank your web page or blog post at the top of the Search Engine Result Pages
    (SERPs), which helps to increase the page views and organic traffic.  </p>
