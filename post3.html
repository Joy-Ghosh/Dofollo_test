<p>Internal Linking is crucial for SEO. A balanced on-page optimization should include creating relevant internal links
    for your pages and blog posts for better SEO rankings.</p>

<p>But how do you go about creating those internal links? Surely, it's more than just randomly stumbling upon keywords
    and phrases on your pages &amp; linking them to other pages without any thoughts or a clear target.</p>

<p>This type of stray link-building shows a clear lack of an internal link-building strategy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Internal link can give your content that extra bit of rocket fuel that helps it propel into the top of Google search
    rankings, but only if it's done correctly.</p>

<p>Here, we have curated a list of best practices for internal linking that helps you create internal links with a clear
    aim to rank your target pages higher instead of just building random links &amp; praying to Google for that top
    ranking.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Is An Internal Link?</h2>

<p>Internal links are essentially bridges to another destination.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The idea of contextual internal links is to help the audience of your website or blog to find more information about
    a topic, the page you are linking to should be a sub topic of your current page.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img
        src="https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Internal-Linking.png" alt="Example of Internal Linking "
        class="wp-image-1822" />
    <figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Example of internal linking</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Hence, you should only hyperlink to pages that add more value to your topic and not just add <a
        href=\"https://dofollo.ai/blog/find-internal-links-any-page/\">internal links</a> for the sake of it.</p>

<p>The bridge should take you to a different destination but that's related to your original location, it only retains
    relevance if the destination is related to the origin.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Are Internal Links Important For SEO</h2>

<p>SEO used to be all about the backlinks, adding some valuable backlinks used to give the deceased results. Today's SEO
    is a far cry from it.</p>

<p>But, the backlinks still carry the most value. Content is the king, but there’s still a kingmaker.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can still get that vote of confidence from valuable websites and rank very well. Although you have to look for
    links from your niche and other criteria, SEO experts will come up with links that still work.</p>

<p>Internal links have the same principle, if you have a page that's ranking well on Google, getting regular traffic or
    has a lot of good quality links from those pages can help you rank other pages on your website.</p>

<p>You need to make sure the internally linked pages are relevant to each other.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Many Types Of Internal Links Are There?</h2>

<p>Internal links can be divided into different types,</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li>Navigational Links
        <ul class="wp-block-list">
            <li>Menu Links</li>

            <li>Header Links</li>

            <li>Footer Links&nbsp;</li>

            <li>Sidebar Links</li>

            <li>Pagination Link</li>

            <li>Breadcrumb Links</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Contextual Links</li>

    <li>Image links</li>

    <li>Call to Action Links.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see above there are many types of internal links, most of the internal links types are navigational and
    are a part of website structure, that's all the links you see under navigational links.</p>

<p>While the call-to-action links are used to improve conversions, for the purposes of SEO, we would only discuss the
    contextual links.</p>

<p>Creating proper semantic context can help you improve the SEO of your website.</p>

<p><a href=\"https://dofollo.ai/blog/what-is-dofollo/\">Dofollo</a> helps you create those powerful internal links to
    boost ranking of the year target page.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although finding semantic internal link opportunities and adding those internal links to your web pages is a lot
    easier with Dofollo, here are the internal linking best practices you can follow to create the same high-quality
    internal links for your website.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Internal Link Best Practices.</h2>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Choosing Your Target Page.</h3>

<p>The First step is to choose the page you wish to rank for. This is probably the easiest as most of you probably
    already have the page in mind. But here are a few things you should keep in mind when showing the target page.</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li>The Page should be relevant to the central theme of your website. If you do not have pages that are relevant to
        your target page, you will not have any pages to link from.</li>

    <li>The keywords or phrases you are trying to rank for should be within means; do not go for keywords that are very
        hard to rank for.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Discover High Authority Page To Build Internal Links.</h3>

<p>To rank higher, you need links from valuable pages. One way to find valuable pages is to find high-authority pages
    that are also semantically close to your target page.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img
        src="https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Page-Authority-1024x535.png" alt="High Authority Page "
        class="wp-image-1815" />
    <figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Visualization of page authority</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You can use tools like&nbsp;Ahref and&nbsp;SEMRush to find pages with the most backlinks, but for the purpose of this
    demonstration, we would use the Google Search Console Tool as the tool of our choice to find pages with the most
    backlinks.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How To Find High Authority Pages on Google Search Console Tool?</h3>

<p>On your Google Search Console, locate the “Links” option on the left-hand menu. This would show you both the internal
    link &amp; external links.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img
        src="https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Internal-links-checked-by-GSC-Links-section.png"
        alt="Internal links checked through GSC Links section" class="wp-image-1807" style="object-fit:cover" />
    <figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>GSC Links section overview, showing internal and external link
            analysis,</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Under internal links, you will find the “Top linked pages externally” Click on the “more” option under the initial
    list.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img
        src="https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GSC-Internal-link-section-check-more.png"
        alt="Internal links for detailed insights in the GSC Links section" class="wp-image-1809" />
    <figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Internal links for detailed insights in the GSC links section</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This would open the list of pages with their number of backlinks mentioned on the right.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img
        src="https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Top-Internal-Linked-Pages-by-GSC.png"
        alt="Top Internal Linked Pages by GSC" class="wp-image-1810" />
    <figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Top Internal Linked Pages report in Google Search Console</em>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You also have the option to export the report, from there you can find the pages that are relevant to your target
    page &amp; sort them according to their number of backlinks if your donor list is sizable.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Build Internal Links on Pages With Organic Traffic</h3>

<p>Another way to find a list of your prospective donor pages for your internal links is to find pages on your website
    that already have some organic traffic to it.</p>

<p>Pages with organic traffic are great indicators of value. If Google is ranking your page high enough to get organic
    clicks it is assigning the age some authority.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img
        src="https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Organic-Search-.png"
        alt="Organic search results by Google analytics" class="wp-image-1811" />
    <figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Organic search results overview in Google Analytics</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You can not only distribute that page authority to semantically related pages on your website, but internal links on
    pages with organic traffic also divert real users to your target pages.</p>

<p>This flow of real visitors is a strong ranking signal for Google's search ranking algorithm.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How To Find Pages With Organic Traffic on Google Search Console Tool?</h3>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Ensure The Semantic Relation Between Pages</h3>

<p>Once you have the list of prospect keywords ready, you need to open them on your browser one by one and make sure the
    topic of your target page is really relevant to the donor page.</p>

<p>It's even better if the main topic of your target page is more like a subtopic of the donor page.</p>

<p>Assuring the relevance of your pages are crucial when building internal links.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What Are Semantic Relevance?</h3>

<p>Saying two pieces of content share semantic relevance means these two pieces of content are closely related in terms
    of their topic coverage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, a blog post related to on-page SEO would be semantically related to an internal link-building blog post
    like this one.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Use Descriptive Anchor Text For Internal Links</h3>

<p>While Selecting anchor text for your internal links, try to choose descriptive anchor text. Ideall,y your anchor
    texts should describe the content of your target page.</p>

</figure>

<p>This linking style helps both search engines and your audience understand the context of your target page, which is
    great for your user experience.</p>

<p>Avoid building internal links with just one of two words as their anchor text.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Choose A Contrasting Hyperlink Text Color</h3>

<p>Building internal links is not just for SEO ranking; it also helps your users to find valuable information on your
    website.</p>

<p>Make sure your internal link stands out from the regular text well enough so your audience can visually distinguish
    them while scanning the webpage, even on a mobile device.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img
        src="https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Contrasting-hyperlink-text-color.png"
        alt="Contrasting hyperlink text color" class="wp-image-1816" />
    <figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Example of contrasting hyperlink text color</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A good practice is to make the color of your hyperlink to the main theme color of your website, here are some great
    examples of this.</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li><a href="https://neilpatel.com/">neilpatel.com</a></li>

    <li><a href="https://semrush.com">semrush.com</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This contrast of your hyperlinks looks great, and they improve the click-through rate of your internal links.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Limit The Number Of Link In A Page</h3>

<p>Internal links are great for improving the ranking of your pages, but they should be built in moderation.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t want to build too many of them as that would dilute their link juice, having too many links from a page
    would reduce the average influence of each internal link from that Page.</p>

<details class="wp-block-details has-text-color has-link-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#326750">
    <summary>How Many Internal Links Is Too Many?</summary>
    <p class="has-medium-font-size">But how many is too many? Well, for internal links, most SEO experts recommend
        sticking below internal links per to words. But, most bigger well-known blogs usually build more internal links,
        especially on older blog posts.</p>

    <p class="has-medium-font-size"><br>If you are not sure what limit you should set for yourself, you can use Dofollo
        to check the behemoths, your competitors or the page ranking at the top of Google search and see how many
        internal links they are adding to their blogs.</p>
</details>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Avoid No-follow Links</h3>

<p>Conventional wisdom is, Do-follow links pass link juice as well as navigating the user while No-follow links do not
    pass the link authority, they are used for navigational purposes.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img
        src="https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Nofollow-Tag.png" alt="Nofollow Tag"
        class="wp-image-1817" style="object-fit:cover" />
    <figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Example of the 'nofollow' tag in use</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>While, If No-Follow has zero link authority or lower link authority could be up for debate, it is best to avoid the
    no-follow when building internal links.</p>

<details class="wp-block-details has-text-color has-link-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#326750">
    <summary>How to build dofollow links?</summary>
    <p>All links that you create through the WordPress editor are dofollow by default unless you add the nofollow tag.
    </p>

    <p>Nofollow links have specified it by adding a “nofollow” tag.</p>
</details>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Add External Links</h3>

<p>Links help your pages to rank, but it's not just limited to backlinks and internal links.&nbsp;</p>

<p>External links, too, can help you rank your pages. This might seem counterintuitive but a meaningful external link
    that elevates user experience does help you rank higher.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img
        src="https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/External-links--1024x535.png"
        alt="count of external links in dofollo tools" class="wp-image-1818" />
    <figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Visualization of the count of external links using dofollo tools</em>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But what kind of external links should you build? Links to pages that would provide valuable information to your
    audience, relevance and usefulness are the key here.</p>

<details class="wp-block-details has-text-color has-link-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#326750">
    <summary>How many external links should your page have?</summary>
    <p>Unless you have a listicle on your webpage, it is advisable to have only one or two external links.</p>
</details>

<p>A good practice is to make external links that open in new tabs instead of closing your own website and redirecting
    your audience there, as this would reduce your dwell time.</p>

<p>Also, external links should ideally not be at the beginning of the page.</p>

<details class="wp-block-details has-text-color has-link-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#326750">
    <summary>What Are External Links?</summary>
    <p>External links are links on your page that divert your visitors to a different page outside your own website.</p>
</details>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Add Internal Links To Newly Published Pages and Blog Posts.</h3>

<p>When you publish a page or a blog post, it is usually with the intent of generating organic traffic.</p>

<p>Creating internal links immediately after publishing a new page helps Google and other search engines discover your
    page sooner and it helps you rank as well.</p>

<p>Using Dofollo makes the process easier, just entering the URL of your newly published page would allow you to see a
    list of internal linking opportunities in seconds using Dofollo’s Artificial intelligence.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img
        src="https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Internal-Link-Opportunities.png"
        alt="Internal Link building opportunities" class="wp-image-1819" />
    <figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Identifying internal link opportunities using Dofollo tools</em>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You can also place the internal link from <a href="https://dash.dofollo.ai/">Dofollo console</a>, within seconds your
    newly published blog would have internal links from relevant and high authority pages to help it click the ranking
    ladder.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Run An Internal Link Audit At Regular Intervals</h3>

<p>Internal linking is crucial to SEO for its cost and time benefit. Similar to SEO, building and managing internal
    links is an ongoing process.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You would need to audit internal links of your website on a regular interval to make sure your internal link game is
    at par with other SEO efforts and to make sure you are fully utilizing your internal linking opportunities.</p>

<p>Creating new links and deleting unnecessary links that do not align with your business or revenue goal anymore are
    all part of it.</p>

<p>Apart from these auditing your internal link also allows you to do the following.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Fix Broken Links</h3>

<p>If you are managing bigger websites or managing a plethora of websites, finding those broken links might become a
    painful task. This is especially true if you are running an agency and your client's website has been managed by
    other agencies and freelancers in the past.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Broken-Links.png"
        alt="Fix Broken Links" class="wp-image-1820" />
    <figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Example of broken links</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Finding those broken links and fixing them might resolve a lot of SEO-related issues on your website.</p>

<p>But you need a reliable tool to find those broken pages. Maybe you have access to those tools, too, but replacing
    them is a very time-consuming task. You can now make it smooth and fast with Dofollo.</p>

<p>Dofollo would not only show the broken links to you but also help you replace or remove them.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Fix Orphan Pages</h3>

<p>Orphan pages are not good for SEO; they hurt your SEO. They usually never rank for organic keywords, and having them
    on your website doesn’t make a lot of sense. But it might not always be possible to get rid of those pages.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img
        src="https://dofollo.ai/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Orphan-pages-1.png" alt="Orphan pages"
        class="wp-image-1821" style="object-fit:cover" />
    <figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Visualization of Orphan Pages</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Dofollo allows you to find those orphan pages and link them to other pages on your website that are contextually
    similar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eliminating the orphan pages would help your website in the long run.</p>

<p>I have mentioned the best practices here, and this list would certainly help you improve your on page SEO, but I kept
    the most important of them for the end.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Start Building Internal Links Now.</h2>

<p>Knowledge is power only when you apply your knowledge. These best practices would only make sense when you start
    implementing them on your website or the websites you manage.</p>
